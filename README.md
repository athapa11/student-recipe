# Student Food Recipes
This repository contains code for a student recipe application for mobile development. The app is aimed at students that want to explore cheap, easy and healthy recipes to cook. Users can save recipes and be redirected online to shop for ingredients. Additionally, it supports both phones and tablets, including screen rotations. A user guide on how the app is used can be viewed within the [assets](https://github.com/athapa11/student-recipe/tree/main/assets) folder by accessing the HTML file within the folder.

The app is developed in Java using Android Studio and utilises Firebase and SQLite to host the database. The layout of the app allows for horizontal and vertical scrolling through the use of nested RecyclerViews, to search through recipes in their categories.
